# Stance

> **Handle difficult professional conversations with confidence.**

Stance is a private, browser-only communication toolkit that helps you write confident, natural replies for high-stakes professional conversations — payment follow-ups, salary negotiations, client rejections, complaints, and more.

Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and the Gemini API. Everything runs in your browser. No backend. No database. No data leaves your machine except to the Gemini API.

- **Smart Style Matching** — Add your own writing examples for personalised tone

## 🔑 Gemini API Setup

Stance uses the [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) (`gemini-2.0-flash` model) directly from the browser.

1. Go to [Google AI Studio → API Keys](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key (free tier available)
3. Open Stance in your browser
4. Click the **Settings** icon (⚙️) in the top-right header
5. Paste your API key and click **Save API Key**

> **Privacy:** Your API key is stored only in your browser's `localStorage`. It is never sent to any server except Google's Gemini API directly.
